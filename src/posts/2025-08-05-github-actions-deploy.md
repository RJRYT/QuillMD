# Using GitHub Actions to Deploy Vite Projects Automatically

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) have become essential practices in modern web development. GitHub Actions provides a powerful, free platform for automating your deployment workflows directly from your repository.

## Why Automate Your Vite Deployments?

Manual deployments are prone to human error and can be time-consuming. With GitHub Actions, you can:

- **Ensure consistency** across all deployments
- **Reduce deployment time** from minutes to seconds
- **Automatically run tests** before deployment
- **Deploy to multiple environments** with different configurations
- **Roll back easily** if issues arise

## Setting Up Your First GitHub Action

Create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file in your repository:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        cache: 'npm'
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
      
    - name: Build project
      run: npm run build
      
    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
      if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        publish_dir: ./dist
```

## Advanced Deployment Strategies

### Multi-Environment Deployments

For projects requiring staging and production environments:

```yaml
name: Multi-Environment Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        cache: 'npm'
    
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npm run build
    
    - name: Deploy to Staging
      if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
      run: echo "Deploy to staging environment"
      
    - name: Deploy to Production
      if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
      run: echo "Deploy to production environment"
```

### Optimized Builds with Caching

Speed up your builds by caching dependencies and build artifacts:

```yaml
- name: Cache dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-node-

- name: Cache build
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: dist
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ github.sha }}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Environment Variables and Secrets

Store sensitive data in GitHub Secrets:

```yaml
- name: Build with environment variables
  run: npm run build
  env:
    VITE_API_URL: ${{ secrets.API_URL }}
    VITE_APP_KEY: ${{ secrets.APP_KEY }}
```

### 2. Quality Gates

Always run tests before deployment:

```yaml
- name: Run tests
  run: npm test

- name: Run linting
  run: npm run lint

- name: Check build
  run: npm run build
```

### 3. Notifications

Get notified when deployments succeed or fail:

```yaml
- name: Notify on success
  if: success()
  run: echo "Deployment successful!"
  
- name: Notify on failure
  if: failure()
  run: echo "Deployment failed!"
```

## Deploying to Different Platforms

### Vercel

```yaml
- name: Deploy to Vercel
  uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v25
  with:
    vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
    vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.ORG_ID }}
    vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_ID }}
```

### Netlify

```yaml
- name: Deploy to Netlify
  uses: nwtgck/actions-netlify@v2.0
  with:
    publish-dir: './dist'
    production-branch: main
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    deploy-message: "Deploy from GitHub Actions"
  env:
    NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
    NETLIFY_SITE_ID: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_SITE_ID }}
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Failures

- **Memory issues**: Increase Node.js memory limit
- **Missing dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are in package.json
- **Environment variables**: Check all required variables are set

### Permission Issues

- **GitHub Pages**: Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
- **Secrets access**: Ensure secrets are properly configured
- **Branch protection**: Check branch protection rules

## Monitoring and Analytics

Track your deployment metrics:

```yaml
- name: Report deployment metrics
  run: |
    echo "Build time: $(date)"
    echo "Bundle size: $(du -sh dist)"
    echo "Deployment status: Success"
```

## Conclusion

GitHub Actions transforms how we deploy Vite projects by providing reliable, automated workflows. Start with a simple deployment pipeline and gradually add more sophisticated features like multi-environment deployments, quality gates, and monitoring.

The key to successful CI/CD is starting simple and iterating based on your team's needs. With these foundations, you'll have robust, automated deployments that save time and reduce errors.
